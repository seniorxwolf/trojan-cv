Item's Classification Using Computer Vision

# Intent: Object Classification Using Computer Vision
(Regardless of the feasability of the application currently and ignoring the counting aspect for now)

# Futher Details
1. Generating 3D models of Objects (two objects for now). In charge: Noushida.
2. Writing a python code that will take a 3D model as an argument and generate \
\ pictures of it from different angles and distances. In charge: Yousif
(Note: the code writing can start once the file format is identified)
3. Determine the best model to be used (Teachable machine is what I know. In the last\
\ meeting Noushida mentioned a few. If the names of these are provided we can use them). In Charge: Team
4. Using the pictures generated in step 2 to train the model determined in step 3. In Charge: Noushida & Yousif
5. Testing the model & looping through the previous steps as much as needed. In Charge: Team
6. Once, performance is satisfactory developing a UI/UX for user demo
